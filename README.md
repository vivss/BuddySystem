# WiCHacks 2018 - BuddySystem

## Inspiration
We always have that one friend who wanders off whether it's at a party, amusement park, or concert. We want to make sure you can keep your buddy next to you but without the invasiveness of location trackers.

## What it does
Going out for the night? Buddy System lets users create a group of friends they plan on sticking with through the night. Once your friend confirms, users get to set how far away their friend can wander from them and how long they plan on hanging out. Unlike other location trackers, Buddy System only reports a user's location every couple minutes and tells you how far away another buddy is (i.e 30 meters). If your buddy gets outside of your initial range, the app will notify you. 

## How we built it
We built this using Android Studio. We created the sqlLite database on Android and used Android's location services. We also used Illustrator to create some of the designs

## Challenges we ran into
We had difficulties testing the location services on our simulator and neither of us have android devices.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're glad we have a working prototype! :)

## What we learned
We learned how to quickly create a protype!

## What's next for Buddy System
We created Buddy System for friends going out to events. But we can see it being used for parents when they go out with their children, or tour groups.

We're hoping to improve the user experience by reorganizing the flow and layouts.
